		Do you like overthinking the made-up lore behind your favorite forms of electronic entertainment and making connections the game designers probably never even thought about and can easily change? Do you have some crazy ideas you want to share with the world but don't have a place to do so? 
		<br> I do, and if you do as well, then this site is for you!

		On this site, you can submit your own theories about your favorite video games and read other theories by gamers just like you! You can also bring other theories you found online into the spolight by reposting them here - as long as you give credit to the original creator. You can upvote your personal favorites and downvote theories that seem a bit too far-fetched. Leave comments if you have any suggestions or additions and be sure to check in often to catch the latest series from the Big Boss herself. With catagories for numerous game series from multiple different companies, you'll always be able to find something you've never heard before. Who knows... you may just learn a thing or two.
		<br> If you're just looking to check out other people's ideas, go straight to the Theory Library. If you have an idea of your own that you want to share, go to the Office to make an account or sign in to your existing account, then head over to the Analysis Room to start writing your theory!
